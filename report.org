This project aims to implement a solution for the problem of the
number of available captures for the rook on a chessboard: on a
chessboard, where pieces are either *a black rook*, *black bishops* or
*white pawns*, how many pawns can the rook capture? 

#+Begin_src python :session :results output graphics file :file example1.png :output-dir img/ :exports results
draw_board("example1", "4P3/5P2/2P1r3/6P1/4b3/4P3/8/8 w - - 0 1")
#+End_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/example1.png]]

In this example, the rook can only capture 2 pawns: e8 and a6. The
pawn on e3 is blocked by the bishop on e4.
