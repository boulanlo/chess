#+TITLE: Available captures for the rook; a performance analysis on a parallelized version of the problem
#+AUTHOR: Louis Boulanger

* Introduction
This project aims to implement a solution for the problem of the
number of available captures for the rook on a chessboard: on a
chessboard, where pieces are either *a black rook*, *black bishops* or
*white pawns*, how many pawns can the rook capture?

In this example, the rook can only capture 2 pawns: e8 and c6. The
pawn on e3 is blocked by the bishop on e4.

* Base algorithm
The base algorithm is quite simple: given a board and the position of
the rook, we need to iterate on the squares in the 4 directions: if
the first piece encountered is a bishop, there is no capture on this
position; and if it's a pawn, there is a capture. The result is the
sum of the number of captures.

#+begin_src rust
/// Computes the number of pawns the rook can capture in the
/// board's current configuration.
pub fn get_rook_captures(&self) -> usize {
    let start = self.get_rook_position();

    Direction::all() // Looking at all directions (up, down, left, right)...
	.iter()
	.map(|d| {
	    match start
		.line(*d, self.size) // ... we look at the line in that direction ...
		.iter()
		.filter_map(|p| self.get_piece(p))
		.next() // .. and get the first piece on the line of sight:
	    {
		None => 0, // If there aren't any, then there is no capture
		Some(k) => match k {
		    PieceKind::Bishop => 0, // If it's a bishop, no capture either
		    PieceKind::Pawn => 1, // If it's a pawn, we capture it
		    PieceKind::Rook => 0, // If it's another rook, no capture
		},
	    }
	})
	.sum() // ... and we sum the number of captures.
}

* First attempt at parallelization using Rayon
We can attempt to parallelize the algorithm in a straightforward
manner, by looking at the 4 different directions in parallel. This
version of the algorithm is quite similar to the sequential one: using
Rayon's powerful parallel iterators, we can simply iterate in parallel
on the directions.

#+begin_src rust
/// Computes the number of pawns the rook can capture in the
/// board's current configuration, in parallel.
pub fn get_rook_captures_par(&self) -> usize {
    let start = self.get_rook_position();

    Direction::all()
	.into_par_iter() // We use a parallel iterator here
	.map(|d| {
	    match start
		.line(d, self.size)
		.iter()
		.filter_map(|p| self.get_piece(p))
		.next()
	    {
		None => 0,
		Some(k) => match k {
		    PieceKind::Bishop => 0,
		    PieceKind::Pawn => 1,
		    PieceKind::Rook => 0,
		},
	    }
	})
	.sum()
}
