#+TITLE: Available captures for the rook; a performance analysis on a parallelized version of the problem
#+AUTHOR: Louis Boulanger

* Foreword
This document has been generated from an =org-mode= file. The source can
be found here ([[file:./report.org][Source]]), and a PDF version here ([[file:./report.pdf][PDF]]). I aimed to have
both the GitHub-ready org-mode file and the PDF to be readable, but
unfortunately, GitHub doesn't support mathematical expressions to be
rendered natively on the preview; so, in order to view correctly the
mathematical formulas throughout the analysis, I recommend reading the
PDF version.

* Introduction
This project aims to implement a solution for the problem of the
number of available captures for the rook on a chessboard: on a
chessboard, where pieces are either *a black rook*, *black bishops* or
*white pawns*, how many pawns can the rook capture?

In this example, the rook can only capture 2 pawns: e8 and c6. The
pawn on e3 is blocked by the bishop on e4.

* Base algorithm
The base algorithm is quite simple: given a board and the position of
the rook, we need to iterate on the squares in the 4 directions: if
the first piece encountered is a bishop, there is no capture on this
position; and if it's a pawn, there is a capture. The result is the
sum of the number of captures.

#+begin_src rust
/// Computes the number of pawns the rook can capture in the
/// board's current configuration.
pub fn get_rook_captures(&self) -> usize {
    let start = self.get_rook_position();

    // Looking at all directions (up, down, left, right):
    Direction::all()
	.iter()
	.map(|d| {
	    match start
		// we look at the line in that direction
		.line(*d, self.size)
		.iter()
		.filter_map(|p| self.get_piece(p))
		// and get the first piece on the line:
		.next()
	    {
		// If there aren't any, then there
		// is no capture
		None => 0,
		Some(k) => match k {
		    // If it's a bishop, no capture either
		    PieceKind::Bishop => 0,
		    // If it's a pawn, we capture it
		    PieceKind::Pawn => 1,
		    // If it's another rook, no capture
		    PieceKind::Rook => 0,
		},
	    }
	})
	// ... and we sum the number of captures.
	.sum()

* First attempt at parallelization using Rayon
We can attempt to parallelize the algorithm in a straightforward
manner, by looking at the 4 different directions in parallel. This
version of the algorithm is quite similar to the sequential one: using
Rayon's powerful parallel iterators, we can simply iterate in parallel
on the directions.

#+begin_src rust
/// Computes the number of pawns the rook can capture in the
/// board's current configuration, in parallel.
pub fn get_rook_captures_par(&self) -> usize {
    let start = self.get_rook_position();

    Direction::all()
	// We use a parallel iterator here
	.into_par_iter()
	.map(|d| {
	    match start
		.line(d, self.size)
		.iter()
		.filter_map(|p| self.get_piece(p))
		.next()
	    {
		None => 0,
		Some(k) => match k {
		    PieceKind::Bishop => 0,
		    PieceKind::Pawn => 1,
		    PieceKind::Rook => 0,
		},
	    }
	})
	.sum()
#+end_src

** Theoretical performance analysis of the parallel version
Let's analyze the parallel algorithm. We first formally define a board
as a 2-dimensional space of size $N^2$. There are 4 parallel branches,
each iterating on successive squares of the board. Deciding on the
capture is $\mathcal{O}(1)$, so the exploration of a line takes
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ at most.

We then have a work of $W = \mathcal{O}(4N)$, and a depth of
$D = \mathcal{O}(N)$. It is obvious here that having more than 4
processors for the task is going to be detrimental for the
performances.
